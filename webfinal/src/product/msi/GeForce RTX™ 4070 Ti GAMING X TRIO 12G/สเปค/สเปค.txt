TRI FROZR 3 Thermal Design
⚫TORX Fan 5.0: Fan blades linked by ring arcs and a fan cowl work together to stabilize and maintain high-pressure airflow.
⚫Copper Baseplate: The CNC machined nickel-plated copper base captures heat from the GPU and the memory then rapidly transfers it to Core Pipes.
⚫Core Pipe: A section of square-shape heat pipes make maximum contact over the GPU, then spread the heat to the heatsink.
⚫Airflow Control: Sections of different heatsink fins disrupt unwanted airflow harmonics and reduce noise.

Dual BIOS
⚫Dual BIOS gives you the choice to prioritize full performance in GAMING mode or low noise in SILENT mode.

Afterburner
